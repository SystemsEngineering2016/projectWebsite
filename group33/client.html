						<h2>Client Meetings & Feedback</h2>
						<p>We kept in constant contact with our client right from our initial meeting, through developent all the way until our final delivery meeting. We see the client-developer relationship one of the most important aspects of the project and always tried to have a constant, clear communication chain with him. We did this through a variety of in-person meetings, web conferences and telephone calls all of which are summarised below. You can also see the clients final feedback for our final Proof Of Concept applicaton which we delivered to him on 18th April 2017. </p>

						<h2> Final Client Feedback </h2>
						<p> Our client gave us some feedback via email after our final meeting on Wednesday 19th April 2017. His comments were: </p>
						<p> "Thank you for running through the Maple product today. This tool is going to help with managing the data dictionaries associated with OpenEyes and the other clinical systems it shares data with. I especially liked how clean and easy it is to update dictionary entries and make mappings between dictionary data points. Very good job. I look forward to using Maple and adding even more features in the near future. <br><br> Thank you for your great work. It has been a pleasure working with you."</p>
