						<h2>Testing</h2>
						<p>We know it is vital to test our project in order to make sure it does what it is intended to do. We firstly need to make sure that the client (end user) is happy with the application we have made and its functionality as he is the person who will be using Maple going forward. We therefore created a series of test cases and demonstrated/allowed the client to use the features in order to obtain his feedback. We also asked others to use our application and note the test cases in order to get a wider range of feedback to get an idea of things such as user experience. <br> <br>We thought it was important to test each development iteration of our application in order to make sure our client was always happy. We therefore demonstrated each iteration to him and collected his feedback before moving on to the next development iteration. Each set of feedback, along with the details of each iteration can be seen here: <br> <br>
							<a class="btn btn-default" href="iteration1.html#feedback1" role="button">Iteration 1 Feedback</a><br>
							<a class="btn btn-default" href="iteration2.html#feedback2" role="button">Iteration 2 Feedback</a><br>
							<a class="btn btn-default" href="iteration3.html#feedback3" role="button">Iteration 3 Feedback</a><br>
							<a class="btn btn-default" href="iteration4.html#feedback4" role="button">Iteration 4 Feedback</a><br><br>


					 General feedback for our final application can be seen below whilst our clients final feedback can be seen <a href = "client.html#finalFeedback" >here </a> </p>

				        <td>User should be able to view all systems</td>
				        <td>1) The navbar made it very easy to navigate to the section where I could view all systems <br> 2) I especially liked the search feature, it saved time rather than searching all of the systems manually </td>
				       </tr>
				      <tr>
				        <td>Systems should be able to be edited (name and active status)</td>
				        <td>1) The pencil icon was clear as it is universally used on many applications <br> 2) I liked the hover over text that said what the icon did as it confirmed my thoughts, adding an extra layer to the user experience</td>
				      </tr>

				      <tr>
				        <td>User should be able to create a new version</td>
				        <td>1) The create versions link in the navbar was very clear to me along with the dropdown to choose a system <br> 2) There were multiple routes in order to get to the create versions page, and at first I struggled to realise that they led to the same page</td>
				      </tr>
				      <tr>
				        <td>User should be able to view all versions</td>
				        <td>1) The view versions link on the home page was particularly clear <br> 2) The fact that all system names were a link within the Systems list made it very clear that that took me to more information regarding the versions </td>
				      </tr>
							<tr>
				        <td>User should easily be able to add, edit and delete data points</td>
				        <td>1) The hover text on the name of versions in the version list stated "click to view data points" so it wasn't very clear that this was also the link to add new data points <br> 2) The button to add new data points was very clear </td>
				      </tr>
							<tr>
				        <td>User should be able to create a mapping between two versions</td>
				        <td>1)The shortcut on the homepage made navigation to the mapping page. Once there the instructions were clear on how to map between versions. <br> 2) Having to be redirected to a new page to choose the version for each system to map was an extra click that I felt could have been avoided</td>
				      </tr>

							<tr>
				        <td>User should be able to view and delete mappings</td>
				        <td>1) The view all mappings page was clear with the bin icon clearly being the delete feature <br> 2) At first I didn't see the bin icon for deletion as you had to scroll to the end of the table</td>
				      </tr>

							<tr>
								<td>System names must be unique</td>
								<td>1) I was not allowed to enter two identical system names <br> 2) The error message was clear and let me know to choose a new, unique name</td>
							</tr>

								<td>Version names must be unique</td>
								<td>1) The validation worked for me <br> 2) I tried to enter a version name that was already used an I was not allowed</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>A set of data points cannot be added unless a logical name is given</td>
								<td>1) I left the logical name blank and I was not allowed to submit the data points <br> 2) It was not clear to me that the logical name was manditory before submission</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>A duplicate mapping cannot be made</td>
								<td>1) I was not allowed to make a duplicate mapping <br> 2) It would be good to not allow a selection of data points that have already been mapped to by disabling the radio buttons</td>
