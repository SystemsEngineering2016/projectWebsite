						<h2>Critical Evaluation</h2>
						<p>Below is a critical evaluation of our project including sections such as its architecture, user interface and future work. </p>
					</header>
					<div class="box">
						<h2> Architecture Design </h2>

            <p>We used a Model, View, Controller design pattern for our application and it made up the main architecture of our web app. The fact that we used this pattern meant that we could neatly organise our code into its individual sections and allowed for good coding practice from the offset. It also means that should our clients developers need to edit or check our code then it should be clear to them how everything comes together.</p>
            <p>We also carefully designed our database system, making sure we used correct relationships between all of our tables. We did this by deciding the “hierarchy” of our tables and working our way down to the least important one. For example within our application, “Systems” was the top table, followed by “Versions” which had a foreign key “SystemID” from the Systems table. We then worked our way down into “DataPoints” and “Mappings” which were all connected with foreign key. This process meant that we could avoid data duplication and data inconsistencies within our database which is something we aimed to avoid from the start. For example rather than storing a new entry of “System Name” within each Version table, we can find the system name from the System table using the “SystemID” foreign key. This means that should the System Name be changed then that will automatically filter through all of our tables rather than having inconsistencies throughout.</p>

            <h2>User interface design and user experience </h2>
            <p>An easy to use and clear user interface was one of the most important factors we took into account when developing our application. We wanted to make sure that our application was as intuitive as possible and so we made sure this was achieved in a number of different ways. We used icons such as a bin and a pencil for options such as deleting and editing as we see these as universal icons which most people will immediately understand  and so makes the user experience more familiar and simple. We also made sure to add hover over text for each of these options which would explain in more detail the function of these buttons. This was an accessibility feature that we added to make sure that our application could be used by a wide range of people. </p>
            <p>We also added a “Key Features” section to our home page with the intention to be a clear summary of everything Maple can do. We added shortcut buttons in order to go to each of these sections in an attempt to add flow to the user experience. </p>
            <p>In summary we feel that Maple offers a good user experience, being very self explanatory with a good flow between pages. </p>

						<h2>Project Management</h2>
						<p> During the project we made sure to try and manage the splitting of tasks as efficiently as possible. The <b>Management</b> section within this website shows how we used <a href="management.html"> Gaant Charts,</a> and tools such as <a href="tools.html#slack"> Slack,</a> <a href="tools.html#trello">Trello</a> and <a href="tools.html#gdrive">Google Drive</a> to manage development and teamwork in a reliable way. Tools such as Slack meant that we could always be in contact with the team and allowed us to use integrations such as the GitHub integration to make sure we were always up to date with development commits made by other members of the team.
						<p>Wherever possible, we made sure to delegate tasks according to the skills of the team members and it made sure that tasks could be completed to the best of their ability. It also meant that tasks could be completed quicker than it would should another team member have to learn the skills from scratch. </p>
						<p> During development, we did try and evenly distribute the workload between all three members, however Matt and Pius soley completed the development. We tried to make sure that all team members contributed to other aspects of the project - a list of work packages and contributors can be seen <a href="evaluation.html#packages"> here. </a> </p>
						<h2>Future Work</h2>
						<p> If we had another six months to work on the project, there are a number of features we could and would like to add in order to make Maple an even better application. Currently, when a user wants to add a set of data points to a specific version, they must be input either manually or through a set of MySQL insert statements in the backend of the application. Now whilst using MySQL to parse a set of CSV files or equivalent is obviously more efficient than one by one input, having to do this through the backend is not ideal. Therefore, a major future feature we would like to implement would be a loader which would allow a user to simple upload a set of data points into a version by uploading a CSV or SQL file through the front end of Maple. </p>
						<p>Other features we would like to add would be a search bar for the  Data Points Display where a user could search for a particular data point or could use an advanced search and search for a number of search queries. This was a feature we intended to add, however due to time constraints we were not able to and so would definitely add it if we had another six months.  </p>
						<p>Finally, another future addition that has come from our client would be the ability to filter the display of mappings on the “Create Mappings” page. Currently when two systems and versions are chosen, all of the mappings between those chosen versions are shown along with a display of all data points for those versions at the bottom of the page. Now a good improvement here would be to merge these two items into one with a “filter” option. Here, we could have a table which could for example display all data points, or only the mapped ones as per the filter choice. We could also filter it by different attributes, for example “Logical Name” or “Data Type”. </p>
						<p>The above examples are some ways we would improve Maple should we have another six months to work on it. We feel that we completed all of our initial requirements to a good standard, as well as adding additional ones along the way. The above examples would all but improve our application further and create a more enhanced user experience. </p>
